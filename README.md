# Ai based malware abd ransomware detection and securing the model with post-quantum cryptography

## This repository houses a cutting-edge ransomware and malware detection model, boasting an impressive accuracy exceeding 98%. Our model leverages a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture, meticulously trained on a comprehensive dataset to ensure robust and reliable threat identification. Crucially,the integrity and confidentiality of the trained model file are secured using post-quantum cryptography, providing an advanced layer of protection against emerging quantum-era threats. #
